# certbot-zimbra
Automated letsencrypt/certbot certificate deploy script for Zimbra hosts.

The script tweaks zimbra's nginx config to allow access of *.well-known* webserver location from local files instead of redirecting upstream to jsp. So it **may not be used if there's no *zimbra-nginx* package installed**.

Letsencrypt by default tries to verify a domain using https, so the script should work fine if [*zimbraReverseProxyMailMode*](https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Enabling_Zimbra_Proxy_and_memcached#Protocol_Requirements_Including_HTTPS_Redirect)s is set to *both* or *https*. May not work for *http* only.

This is still a BETA script. Tested on:
* 8.7.11_UBUNTU16
* 8.7.11_RHEL7
* 8.6_RHEL7
* 8.6_UBUNTU12

# Requirements

* zimbra-proxy package is required (for !*https* mode)
* of course either `certbot` or `letsencrypt` binary is required

## Certbot/Letsencrypt installation

The preferred way is to install it is by using the wizard [at certbot's home](https://certbot.eff.org/). Choose *None of the above* as software and your operating system. This will allow you to install easily upgradable system packages.

By installing Certbot via packages it automatically creates a cron schedule to renew certificates. We must **disable this schedule** because after the renew we must deploy it in Zimbra. So open `/etc/cron.d/certbot` with your favourite editor and **comment the last line**.

# Limitations

* The script doesn't handle multiple certificates on the same server. See #8 and #17

# Usage

## Zimbra 8.7 single server

Run
`./certbot_zimbra.sh -n`
it should do everything by itself, including **restarting zimbra**.

## Renewal

EFF suggest to run *renew* twice a day. Since this would imply restarting zimbra, once a day outside workhours should be fine. So in your favourite place (like `/etc/cron.d/zimbracrontab`) schedule the commands below, as suitable for your setup:

```
12 5 * * * root /usr/bin/certbot renew --renew-hook "/usr/local/bin/certbot_zimbra.sh -r -d $(/opt/zimbra/bin/zmhostname)"
```
The `--renew-hook` parameter has been added since certbot 0.7.0, so check your version before using it. If it's not supported you should get a workaround, but probably the easiest way is to upgrade it.

The `-d` option is required in order to avoid domain confirmation prompt by the script.

## Renewal using Systemd
The example below uses the renew-hook which will only rerun the script if a renewal was successfull and thus only reloading zimbra when needed.

Create a service file eg: /etc/systemd/system/renew-letsencrypt.service

```
[Unit]
Description=Renew Let's Encrypt certificates
After=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=oneshot
# check for renewal, only start/stop nginx if certs need to be renewed
ExecStart=/usr/bin/certbot renew --quiet --agree-tos --renew-hook "/usr/local/bin/certbot_zimbra.sh -r -d $(/opt/zimbra/bin/zmhostname)"
```

Create a timer file to run the above once a day at 2am: /etc/systemd/system/renew-letsencrypt.timer

```
[Unit]
Description=Daily renewal of Let's Encrypt's certificates

[Timer]
# once a day, at 2AM
OnCalendar=*-*-* 02:00:00
# Be kind to the Let's Encrypt servers: add a random delay of 0–3600 seconds
RandomizedDelaySec=3600
Persistent=true

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
```

Then reload the unit file with
```
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl start renew-letsencrypt.timer
systemctl enable renew-letsencrypt.timer
```

Check the timers status:
```
systemctl list-timers renew-letsencrypt.timer
```


## If you have another webserver in front

*(It may happen even in the best families)*

Say you have apache in front of zimbra (or listening on port 80 only) just run `certbot-auto` to request the certificate for apache, and when done run
```
/usr/local/bin/certbot_zimbra.sh --renew --no-nginx
```
so that it will deploy the certificate in zimbra without patching nginx.

## Creating a patch

Since v0.2 patches are embedded into the script. To produce a patch:

1. make a fresh zimbra installation
1. make a copy of the vanilla `/opt/zimbra/conf/nginx/templates` location (i.e. `cp -r /opt/zimbra/conf/nginx/templates /opt/zimbra/conf/nginx/templates_ORIG`)
1. patch the templates file by adding the `.well-known/acme-challenge` location with a webroot (see existing patches)
1. produce a patchfile, making sure to have only one directory below: `cd /opt/zimbra/conf/nginx/ ; diff -Naur templates_ORIG templates > /tmp/zimbra_YOURVERSION.patch`
1. embed the patch in the *patches* section
1. add the version condition in `patch_nginx` function

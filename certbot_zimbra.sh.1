.SH DESCRIPTION
.IP
This script automates installing, renewing and deploying ACME certificates to Zimbra. It's a wrapper around Certbot and Zimbra tools.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP
Only one option at a time can be supplied. Options cannot be chained.
.SS "Mode selection:"
.TP
\fB\-p\fR | \fB\-\-patch\-only\fR:
does only nginx patching. Useful to be called before renew, in case nginx templates have been overwritten by an upgrade.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR | \fB\-\-new\fR:
performs a request for a new certificate ("certonly"). Can be used to update the domains in an existing certificate.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR | \fB\-\-deploy\-only\fR:
Just deploys certificates. Will detect if it's being run from Certbot renew_hook or \fB\-\-deploy\-hook\fR and only deploy if env variable RENEWED_DOMAINS matches the hostname. If run standalone, assumes valid certificates are in \fI\,/etc/letsencrypt/live\/\fP.
.SS "Global options:"
.TP
\fB\-c\fR | \fB\-\-prompt\-confirm\fR:
ask for confirmation.
.TP
\fB\-q\fR | \fB\-\-quiet\fR:
Do not output anything except errors. Useful for scripts. Implies \fB\-N\fR/\-\-noninteractive.
.TP
\fB\-H\fR | \fB\-\-hostname\fR <my.host.name>:
hostname being requested. If not passed it's automatically detected using "zmhostname". Used as Zimbra server name in zmprov, CN and name for certificate.
.SS "Port check (--patch-only and --new):"
.TP
\fB\-j\fR | \fB\-\-no\-port\-check\fR:
disable port check.
.TP
\fB\-P\fR | \fB\-\-port\fR <port>:
port the web server to use for the ACME HTTP\-01 challenge is listening on. Is detected from zimbraMailProxyPort if not set. Mandatory with \fB\-x\fR/\-\-no\-nginx unless \fB\-j\fR/\-\-no\-port\-check is set.
.SS "Nginx options (--patch-only and --new):"
.TP
\fB\-w\fR | \fB\-\-webroot\fR "/path/to/www":
path to the webroot of alternate webserver. Valid only with \fB\-x\fR/\-\-no\-nginx.
.TP
\fB\-x\fR | \fB\-\-no\-nginx\fR:
Alternate webserver mode. Don't check and patch zimbra\-proxy's nginx. Must also specify \fB\-P\fR/\-\-port and \fB\-w\fR/\-\-webroot.
.SS "Options for -n|--new:"
.TP
\fB\-a\fR | \fB\-\-agree\-tos\fR:

.TP
\fB\-N\fR | \fB\-\-noninteractive\fR:
Pass \fB\-\-non\-interactive\fR to Certbot.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-override\-key\-type\-rsa\fR:
if Certbot >=v2.0.0 has been detected, do not override ECDSA to RSA with "\-\-key\-type rsa" (use this to get the default ECDSA key type, Zimbra does NOT support it!)
.TP
\fB\-e\fR | \fB\-\-extra\-domain\fR <extra.domain.tld>:
additional domain names being requested. Can be used multiple times. Implies \fB\-u\fR/\-\-no\-public\-hostname\-detection.

## v0.7.11

* Fix extracting CA from tls-ca-bundle.pem when spaces are removed from CN (#106)
    - On some RHEL/CentOS/Fedora systems, tls-ca-bundle.pem lists certificate CN's
      with spaces removed. This fixes extraction of the CA in such cases.

## v0.7.10

* Add missing check for --prompt-confirm (#100)
* Improve nginx templates patching process (#101)
    - replace sed with awk script that is much more resilient,
      doesn't care about indentation, handles modified templates
      without breaking
* Separate nginx templates and includes check
    - Previously the templates were patched if the includes were unpatched,
      this happened in the case when the templates were previously patched but
      the nginx restart was rejected or failed. This resulted in the templates
      being patched multiple times.
      Now we check for patched templates first, then check for unpatched includes
      and restart nginx if necessary.
* Restore old nginx templates if patching fails, add more status output
* Rework certbot version detection (#104)
    - fix improper pipeline syntax
    - detect certbot errors and grep parsing errors separately
    - print helpful error message prompting the user to run certbot by itself
      in case it may need to bootstrap
* Lowercase local variable
* Use gawk (GNU awk) and add it to dependency check (fixes #102)
* Add zmhostname to dependency check

## v0.7.9

* Re-add showing certbot version if prompt-confirm isn't set
* Move get_domain to bootstrap()
* Handle interactive certbot bootstrap (#99)
  - add --no-bootstrap to certbot --version if --prompt-confirm is not set
      (exit with error if certbot needs to bootstrap)
  - pass through --noninteractive (answers yes to all certbot questions)
* README: replace @jjakob e-mail with username
* README: remove --cert-name from command as it's already passed
* README: fix typo
* README: remove reference to 0.5 stable version, tone down warnings

## v0.2-alpha

Half rewrite of the first version:

* now patching all nginx templates instead of just http/https: all cert requests goes straight to nginx. Less variations, less problems
* improved README documentation
